# React-Tutorial-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a basic solution to the react tutorial to play tic-tac-toe. The files index.css and index.js should be set in the /src folder of a
react projec. The set up is the same as running through the tutorial provided from: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html, but the 
source files were altered to provide solutions to the questions found at the bottom of the page and clean up the page so the board is larger
and the display is set up more cleanly. 

Questions from the site:
1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
